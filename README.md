# PRODIGY-task-1-
# Task-01: Data Visualization

## Objective
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of data using bar charts and histograms.

## Description
In this task, I analyzed population data and created:
- A **histogram** to understand the distribution of population values for the year 2022.
- A **bar chart** to visualize the **top 10 countries by population in 2022**.

These visualizations help in understanding data distribution and comparing population values across countries.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task was provided by **Prodigy InfoTech** for Task-01.

## Output
- Histogram showing population distribution (2022)
- Bar chart showing top 10 countries by population (2022)

## Conclusion
This task helped me strengthen my understanding of data visualization techniques and the appropriate use of bar charts and histograms for categorical and numerical data.
